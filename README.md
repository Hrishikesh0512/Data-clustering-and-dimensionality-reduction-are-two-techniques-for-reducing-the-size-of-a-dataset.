# Project Description
Assume you want to create an environment that can predict a class/category from a dataset based on the class's distinct characteristics. However, none of the traits are strong enough, or, to put it another way, there isn't enough variation/uniqueness between the classes. As a result, you must create a clustering model.

# Solution
# Determining nunmber of clusters by Elbow Plot
